//! Tensor-parallel gates: a two-rank engine must agree with one rank on the
//! same checkpoint, prompts and batch. This is the check that the sharded
//! loader, the two reductions and the per-rank KV stay in step; it drives the
//! real launch path, not a hand-built stack.
//!
//! It compares *distributions*, not greedy tokens. A two-rank reduction sums
//! the same products in a different order than one rank does, and NCCL writes
//! bf16 back, so the logits differ in their last bits and a near-tie can flip
//! the greedy pick. The engine's own docs say as much — greedy is reproducible
//! for a fixed workload, not across two arithmetic orders — so the gate holds
//! the top-k logprobs to a line and requires a differing pick to be a genuine
//! near-tie (each pick inside the other run's top-k).
//!
//! Two GPUs are mandatory, so these run one at a time on a box that has them.
