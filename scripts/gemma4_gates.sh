# Maintainer runner for the Gemma 4 checkpoint-backed gates and the Gemma
# contracts that live in the kernels and frontend crates.
#
# The checkpoint-backed gates need real weights, fixtures and a device; the
# kernels contracts need only a device. This script owns their execution:
# it refuses to start unless every prerequisite is present, it holds each
# discovered gate set against the manifest here so a gate cannot quietly leave
# the suite. It claims one physical device for the suite's lifetime and runs one
# gate per process — repeated checkpoint loads in one test binary exhaust a
# 48 GiB card.

#
# A filter runs the subset of manifest gates whose names contain it; the

#   fixtures    all four tensor fixtures, held against the checkpoint's digests
# and a run demands only the union over the gates it selects, so a filter can
